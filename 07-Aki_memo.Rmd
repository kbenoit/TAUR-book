# Bookdown Memo (by Aki)

## install bookdown
```
devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

## working with a demo
Fork a [demo-book](https://github.com/amatsuo/bookdown-demo)

Clone the repo. Rroj file works only with the Preview version of RStudio.

### Edit index.Rmd
Following two lines in index.Rmd determine the style of book 
```
site: bookdown::bookdown_site
output: bookdown::gitbook
```
Options for theme of the book is avaialble [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/yaml-options.html)


Other information (title, author etc) will be going this file as well.



### Compile a book
Use "Build book" in `Build` of RStudio. If you choose gitbook format, it will create a book in HTML format under _book folder. After compiling a book, a viewer for selected format will be opened. 

If you are working in an existing project and do not see the option of `Build`, go to "Project Options" and change the build tool to "Website". "Build book" should take care of everything:

1. Build a html book
2. Generate a pdf-book through LaTeX
3. Generate a epub book

In order to check the output in a browser, open `index.html` in the `_book` folder. In browser preview, you can use `edit` function which redirects to a source of Rmd on github. The idea is that other conributors of the book edit source and send a pull-request.

### Start a project from sratch

Create a new project. Generate a new index.Rmd. The header should look like:

```
---
title: "Index"
author: "Akitaka Matsuo"
date: "24 October 2016"
output: bookdown::gitbook
site: bookdown::bookdown_site
---
```

### Adding chapters
Add a new Rmd file (need to delete headers)

### Referencing figures and tables

`\@{fig:figname}` and `\@{tab:tablename}`. Fignames defined after the syntax highlighting methods in code-chunks, like `{r nice-fig`.
Go Chater 1 to see working examples.

### Align equation
This syntax works:

```{latex}
\begin{align}
  a &= b \\
  c &= d
\end{align}
```
The code above creates following output
\begin{align}
  a &= b \\
  c &= d
\end{align}
